# ⛰️ MountainPass Digital Holding System

**MountainPass** is a Clarity smart contract protocol for secure and temporary digital asset custody with built-in conditional release logic. Designed for applications like digital escrows, milestone-based disbursements, or trustless intermediated transfers, MountainPass ensures assets are held securely until all predefined release conditions are met.

## 🌐 Overview

MountainPass enables:

- **Secure Temporary Custody** — Assets are held in a protected smart contract environment.
- **Condition-Based Release** — Assets are only released when specific, verifiable conditions are satisfied.
- **Multi-Use Flexibility** — Ideal for digital escrows, service contracts, milestone-based payments, or DAOs needing controlled custody mechanics.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Custody Vault Logic:** Assets are deposited and held securely with enforced non-custodial ownership.
- **Conditional Unlock System:** Supports programmable rules for time locks, multi-signature approvals, or external trigger mechanisms.
- **Audit-Ready Design:** Transparent and verifiable logic suitable for trustless environments.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Asset Deposit** — A user or contract deposits assets into the MountainPass vault.
2. **Condition Monitoring** — Predefined release conditions are monitored (e.g., time, signature count, event trigger).
3. **Asset Release** — Once the condition is fulfilled, assets are transferred to the designated recipient.

## 🔐 Use Cases

- **Digital Escrow Agreements**
- **Milestone-Based Funding**
- **DAO Treasury Controls**
- **Cross-party Trade with Verification Layers**
